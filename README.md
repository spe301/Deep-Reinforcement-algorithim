# Deep-Reinforcement-algorithim
uses deep reinforcement learning to play Atari games

Very similar to Deep Q learning except with a second network that took in both action space and observation space
, in order to filter out the agent's 'bad actions'. Having this network only imporved preformance by about 5 - 10 points on the atari boxing environment, but building it was a fun experiance!
